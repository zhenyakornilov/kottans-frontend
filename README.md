## **Git, GitHub, git flow**
- Listened week 1 and week 2 of [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)

      ![flexbox_froggy](/task_responsive_web_design/flexbox_froggy.png)
    </details>
    
      > The game wasn't that hard, but it helped me to understand better the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items`
      > and to understand how other properties related to flexbox work as well.
4. Watched lectures about [CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm)

  > To summarize, here I gained a lot of new information since I've never used Flexbox and CSS grid before 
  > (except using Bootstrap framework where CSS Grid is predefined so I didn't need to write these CSS rules on my own.
  > I am definetly going to use both Flexbox and CSS Grid in my next task.

- [Demo](https://zhenyakornilov.github.io/kottans_html_css_practise/)
- [Code base](https://github.com/zhenyakornilov/kottans_html_css_practise)

  > This task was so challenging for me to complete. 
  > The hardest part for me were CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid and aligning items at all since I never used CSS that much before.
  > I spent a lot of time doing this task but also I learned a lot new stuff to me.

    </details>
    
      > To begin with, I was familiar with JS before a bit, but here I had a lot of practice with functional programming and algorithms. 
      > It was engaging to know that Array in JavaScript is actually not a separate data type as it is in many 
      > other programming languages, but just an object. 
      > Still, things like algorithms and recursions are not easy to me to understand but I'm sure it comes clearer after more practice.

      > Now I know that unlike CSS, JS is able to get elemnt in any place of the document.
2. Completed tasks 12 - 18 [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#functional-programming)

      > I could'nt solve tasks like Fibonacci, Steamroller and Smallest common multiple without hints, 
      > while actually the others of this six tasks weren't that challenging and I solved them on my own. 
      > Still, the hardest concept to understand for me is recursions (and algorithms too, of course), 
      > more precisely they are understandable, but I can't implement them yet whithout hints.
3. JS-Dom practice
- [Demo](https://zhenyakornilov.github.io/kottans-js-dom-practice/)

      > It was unexpected to know that unlike in Python, classes in JavaScript are primarily 
      > syntactical sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance. 
      > As for me, classes syntax looks more clear than prototype syntax.
      > The more I learn JavaScript, the more i see difference over Python. 
      > It is facinating to learn that both Python and JavaScript look similar but have so much differences in detail.

  </details>
  
   > I got a lot of new information in this course. Now I understand how web pages are able to load content even if connection is lost or too slow.
   > Everething in this course was new to me. I heard about caching before but didn't know hot to implement.
   > Some cons of this course is that it is outdated. I wasted some time to make starting files work on my machine and even course repo troubleshooting 
   > chapter couldn't help me. For sure, I need to rewatch this course as I still don't quite understood the IndexedDB section. 
   > A little practice might help me too, I guess.
